Android appplication that I built for my senior project 

It is divided in a Server application and a Client application both have to run on an Android phone.

Once the server application is running, the client can login or register. 

After that is successful, it is redirected to the main screen, where you can play a game versus the computer. There is an esay mode (computer makes random moves) and a hard mode (computer uses MinMax algorithm).

In addition, there is a Multiplayer mode where you can play a game against someone online, It uses TCP/IP protocol to match two players connected to the server.

Finally, it has a Leaderboard in which you can see the players with more wins in the multiplayer mode.
